The Smart Farming system is an Internet connected device (IoT device) comprising of a SBC Raspberry Pi 3 which acts as a central hub and an Arduino microcontroller which acts as a satellite node. The system is used for analysing the variations in interesting data collected from the sensors and act on the data to control the farming process. The system includes multiple sensors like a soil moisture sensor, a temperature sensor and a humidity sensor. Using the data collected, the quality and state of the soil is judged and based on preset thresholds the actuators are activated. The data collected are also transmitted to the central hub where it is stored in a MYSQL database making it easily accessible on the internet from anywhere in the world in the form of charts that can be easily interpreted by the common man. The website is available at the radix domain name intellifarm.website which is hosted on Amazon Web Services where the user can login using the correct credentials.
